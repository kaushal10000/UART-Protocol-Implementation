UART Protocol Implementation:

• Designed and implemented the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) protocol in Verilog HDL for serial communication.

• Developed features for start-stop synchronization, data framing, and error detection to ensure reliable transmission.

• Utilized UART for communication with various modules such as GPS and Bluetooth.
